    "# Generating Word Embeddings - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn how to generate word embeddings by training a Word2Vec model, and then embedding layers into Deep Neural Networks for NLP!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate a basic understanding of the architecture of the Word2Vec model\n",
    "* Demonstrate an understanding of the various tunable parameters of Word2Vec such as vector size and window size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll start by creating your own word embeddings by making use of the Word2Vec Model. Then, you'll move onto building Neural Networks that make use of **_Embedding Layers_** to accomplish the same end-goal, but directly in your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the easiest way to make use of Word2Vec is to import it from the [Gensim Library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). This model contains a full implementation of Word2Vec, which you can use to begin training immediately. For this lab, you'll be working with the [News Category Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset/version/2#_=_).  This dataset contains headlines and article descriptions from the news, as well as categories for which type of article they belong to.\n",
